Game "Stone Paper Scissors"
---------------------------
How to play:
1. Download gameRPS.jar file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory with the file.
3. Run the program and specify the names of the moves. For example:
    `java -jar gameRPS.jar rock paper scissors`
4. The number of moves must be more than three and odd.
5. You can make a move with a line with its name or number.
6. You will see a random key and a HMAC from the computer's move. So you can check that the computer hasn't changed its move after your move.
